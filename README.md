This repository contains the implementation of several traditional Machine Learning algorithms on the Kaggle Transaction Fraud.
The description of the dataset can be found below and the dataset can be downloaded from [**"Credit Card Fraud Dataset"**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download).

### Dataset

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

Given the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.

### Model

The Machine Learning models used are Random Forest Regression, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree Regression



### Configuration

The clone the repository:
```shell script
git clone git@github.com:giovannicatalani/FraudDetection.git
```
The model uses the **ImbLearn** library.


### Metrics
The Metrics used are True Positive Rate (also known as recall): number of correctly predicted Frauds (TP) divided by total Frauds in the test set (TP + FN).
False Positive Rate (also known as fall-out): number of falsely predicted Frauds (FP) divided by total Regular transaction in the test set (FP + TN)
True Negative Rate (also known as specificity): 1 - False Positive Rate

### Results
The correlation between input features and Classes is shown is the following plot.

The results of the metrics on the 3 methods without and with SMOLE are summarized below. Balancing the classes seen during training increases the performance of all models.
